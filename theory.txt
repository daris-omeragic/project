It can be a class component or a functional component.
Class component is a js class that extends React.Component class, while a functional component is a js
function that returns only the React eleemnt


A PureComponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component,but with additional features
or optimizations.When a component is a PureComponent,
React will do a shallow compresiom of props and state before re-rendering the component. That means that if
props and state have nit changed , the component will not be re-rendering .This can lead to a performance boost in some cases,
but if it's not used property,
it can lead to unexpected behaviour.


Bottomline, a component is the most basic and most used for building a block in React and PureComponent
is used whan it needs some special optimizations.


Props (properties) is a way for manipulating data and states
We can send data through props and we can send
data to parent through props



Parent component is component which is created
Chlid component is component which is included in Parent component
Parent component can have more than one Child component
Child component can be also found in other components as chlidern(pop)
childern is a props is a reserved name.


rm - is a commad which removes file or directory
